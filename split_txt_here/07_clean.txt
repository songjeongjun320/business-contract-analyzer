Additional Insureds - The required insurance policies, with the exception of the Worker's Compensation and Contractors Professional Liability, 
must name the General Contractor, Owner, and others required in the Subcontract Documents (including their directors, officers, employees, and 
agents) as additional insureds, arising out of work performed (including completed operations) under the Contract Documents. The Commercial 
General Liability policy shall specifically include ISO Additional Insured Endorsements CG 2010 and CG 2037 10-01 editions, or equivalent. 
Subcontractor's insurance, including the Umbrella/Excess Liability, shall be primary and non-contributory with any insurance maintained by such 
additional insureds.

Waiver of Subrogation - Subcontractor waives its right(s) of subrogation, and shall require its insurers to endorse the Workers Compensation, 
Commercial General Liability, Automobile Liability, Property/Contractor's Equipment, Environmental/Pollution Liability and Watercraft/Aircraft 
Liability insurance policies required under this Agreement to waive all rights of subrogation against the Additional Insureds and Indemnitees. For 
the Automobile Insurance, the Waiver of Subrogation shall apply to both liability and physical damage.

Other Requirements - The required insurance policies must be endorsed to require thirty (30) days of advance written notice to the General 
Contractor in the event of any cancellation or reduction in coverage. All insurers must possess an A.M. Best rating of A-VII or better and be 
authorized to do business in the state or states where the work is to be performed. Upon written request from General Contractor, Subcontractor 
must supply certified copies of the required insurance policies within ten (10) days. Deductibles or SIRs may not exceed $25,000 without the 
General Contractor's approval.

Certificates of Insurance and Policies - Prior to commencing work but no later than ten (10) days from the date of this Subcontract, Subcontractor 
must provide properly completed certificates of insurance on Accord forms which evidence the required insurance. The certificates must 
specifically list each of the required additional insureds and specify that a Waiver of Subrogation Endorsement applies to the required insurance 
policies. The certificates must be accompanied by all required endorsements. Subcontractor agrees to furnish General Contractor with the same 
evidence of insurance required from each Sub-Subcontractor employed by the Subcontractor. Subcontractor shall provide copies of the required 
insurance policies within 10 days of written request by General Contractor.

Subcontractor expressly agrees that the General Contractor is authorized to withhold payments to the Subcontractor until the General Contractor 
receives evidence of insurance as required herein.

Scope/Limits of Insuranceâ€“ To the fullest extent permitted by law, the coverage provided to the Additional Insureds must be at least as broad as 
that provided to the named insureds under the policy. In the event that any required insurance policy states that coverage to an additional insured 
shall be no broader than that required by contract, the Subcontractor and General Contractor agree that nothing in this Agreement is intended to 
restrict or limit the breadth of coverage.  In the event the Subcontractor maintains higher insurance limits than set forth herein, such higher limits 
shall be deemed to be required by General Contractor.
